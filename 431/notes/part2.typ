== Discrete random variable
 For $A = {k_1,k_2,...,} $ s.t. random variable$X in A$, or $P(X in A) = 1$, X is a random variable, with possible values $k_1,k_2,...$ and $P(X=k_n)>0$
=== Probability Mass Function (pmf)
The PMF is a function that defines the probability distribution for a discrete random variable. It gives the probability of the random variable taking on each possible value. The PMF, denoted as $P(X = x)$, satisfies two conditions:

$ P(X = x) >= 0 "for all x in the domain of" X $
$ sum_x P(X = x) = 1 $
Example: For a fair six-sided die, the PMF would be $P(X = x) = 1/6$ for $x = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6$.

== continuous Random Variables
Not rigorously defined in this class, but a continuous random variable is one that can take on any value in a range. The probability of a continuous random variable taking on a specific value is 0.
